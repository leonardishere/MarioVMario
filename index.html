    <h1>Mario V Mario</h1>
    <p>Mario V Mario is a machine learning project that got pushed to the side and may be revisited in the future. At the moment, it serves as a good example of using JavaScript and JQuery to create an interactive page.</p>
    <p>Instructions: This game is meant to just be watched. If you would like to play, the WASD keys control Luigi and the R key respawns. On death, a clone of you will be spawned.</p>
    <p>This game is also a (bad) example of machine learning. The marios are controlled using neural networks and are trained via genetic algorithms. Clones are trained via gradient descent of your moves.</p>
    <p>The repo for this is hosted <a href="https://github.com/leonardishere/MarioVMario" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
