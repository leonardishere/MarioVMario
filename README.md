# MarioVMario
A game using genetic algorithms to create the perfect Mario.

The world will spawn with some random artificially intelligent marios. The goal in each iteration is to survive as long as possible and to stomp and many enemies as possible. Doing so will increase the chances of reproducing and passing its genes down to the next iteration.
